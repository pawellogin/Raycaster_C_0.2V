# Raycaster Demo
![](https://github.com/pawellogin/Raycaster_C_0.2V/blob/main/RaycasterDemo.gif)

This raycaster was made in C with the help of [Raylib](https://www.raylib.com/). By using it, I could focus on programming the game itself, the code responsible for the base of displaying the images on the screen was already here.

My main goal with this project was to try to make a base for a "Wolfenstein 3D" clone. Along with it, I had to learn mathematics regarding efficient calculation of ray lengths using the DDA, organizing a dozen files, making something complex, and using version control (initial version is private, with a much bigger commit history) that I can later expand upon.

At the end i know i imporoved my programming skils, and enchaned my thingns and problem solving skils.  

In the future, when I will be learning a graphical API, this will be a project I will fondly come back to.
